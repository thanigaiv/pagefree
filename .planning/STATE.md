# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** Reliable alert delivery and escalation - ensuring critical alerts reach the right on-call engineer within seconds
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & User Management

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation & User Management)
Plan: 5 of 10 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 01-05-PLAN.md (Break-glass authentication)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.33 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation & User Management | 5/10 | 20 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (3 min), 01-03 (4 min), 01-04 (4 min), 01-05 (3 min)
- Trend: Consistent velocity at 4min average

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Phase-Plan | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| UTC timestamp storage via @db.Timestamptz | 01-01 | Prevent timezone bugs across distributed teams |
| Soft delete pattern with isActive flag | 01-01 | Preserve audit trail and foreign key integrity |
| Two-level RBAC (Platform + Team roles) | 01-01 | Support global admins and per-team permissions |
| Break-glass accounts separated via flag | 01-01 | Enable emergency access when Okta unavailable |
| ES modules (type: module) | 01-01 | Modern JavaScript standards and better ESM compatibility |
| Action naming convention (namespace.entity.action) | 01-02 | Consistent audit event identification across system |
| req.audit() helper with automatic context | 01-02 | Reduce boilerplate, ensure IP/user-agent always captured |
| Cleanup scheduled only in production | 01-02 | Avoid unnecessary background jobs in development |
| Platform admins bypass all team role checks | 01-03 | Global admin access pattern per user decision |
| Full visibility model (any user can view teams) | 01-03 | Per user decision for cross-team visibility |
| PermissionResult with allowed/reason pattern | 01-03 | Consistent error messaging for permission denials |
| Role hierarchy with numeric values | 01-03 | Enables minimum role comparisons (OBSERVER < RESPONDER < TEAM_ADMIN) |
| In-memory rate limiting for break-glass | 01-05 | Emergency-only use case doesn't require distributed rate limiting |
| Two-tier rate limiting (5/15min + 3 failed/5min) | 01-05 | Defense in depth: general + failed attempt tracking |
| HIGH severity logging for break-glass | 01-05 | Security visibility for all emergency access usage |
| Generic error messages prevent enumeration | 01-05 | Don't reveal which emails are break-glass accounts |
| CLI tool for break-glass account creation | 01-05 | Secure administrative operation outside web UI |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From research:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Must store all timestamps in UTC to prevent timezone bugs (ADDRESSED: Used @db.Timestamptz in all models)
- Phase 2: Webhook idempotency and signature validation essential (critical pitfall)
- Phase 3: DST handling requires explicit test cases for spring-forward/fall-back scenarios (critical pitfall)
- Phase 4: Alert deduplication needs database transactions to prevent race conditions (critical pitfall)
- Phase 5: Multi-provider notification failover must be built in from start (critical pitfall)

**Current concerns:**
- None - Plans 01-01 through 01-05 completed successfully with no blockers
