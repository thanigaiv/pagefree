## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Phase-Plan | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| UTC timestamp storage via @db.Timestamptz | 01-01 | Prevent timezone bugs across distributed teams |
| Soft delete pattern with isActive flag | 01-01 | Preserve audit trail and foreign key integrity |
| Two-level RBAC (Platform + Team roles) | 01-01 | Support global admins and per-team permissions |
| Break-glass accounts separated via flag | 01-01 | Enable emergency access when Okta unavailable |
| ES modules (type: module) | 01-01 | Modern JavaScript standards and better ESM compatibility |
| Action naming convention (namespace.entity.action) | 01-02 | Consistent audit event identification across system |
| req.audit() helper with automatic context | 01-02 | Reduce boilerplate, ensure IP/user-agent always captured |
| Cleanup scheduled only in production | 01-02 | Avoid unnecessary background jobs in development |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From research:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Must store all timestamps in UTC to prevent timezone bugs (ADDRESSED: Used @db.Timestamptz in all models)
- Phase 2: Webhook idempotency and signature validation essential (critical pitfall)
- Phase 3: DST handling requires explicit test cases for spring-forward/fall-back scenarios (critical pitfall)
- Phase 4: Alert deduplication needs database transactions to prevent race conditions (critical pitfall)
- Phase 5: Multi-provider notification failover must be built in from start (critical pitfall)

**Current concerns:**
- None - 01-01 and 01-02 completed successfully with no blockers
