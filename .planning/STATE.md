### Blockers/Concerns

**From research:**
- Phase 1: Must store all timestamps in UTC to prevent timezone bugs (critical pitfall)
- Phase 2: Webhook idempotency and signature validation essential (critical pitfall)
- Phase 3: DST handling requires explicit test cases for spring-forward/fall-back scenarios (critical pitfall)
- Phase 4: Alert deduplication needs database transactions to prevent race conditions (critical pitfall)
- Phase 5: Multi-provider notification failover must be built in from start (critical pitfall)
