# Requirements Archive: v1.1 Service Catalog

**Milestone:** v1.1 Service Catalog
**Defined:** 2026-02-08
**Shipped:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** Reliable alert delivery and escalation - ensuring critical alerts reach the right on-call engineer within seconds

## v1.1 Requirements (Service Catalog - Table Stakes)

Requirements for service catalog foundation. Service-based alert routing replaces team-based routing.

### Service Foundation

- [x] **SVC-01**: User can create technical service with name, description, routing key, and owning team — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **SVC-02**: User can edit service metadata (name, description, tags) — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **SVC-03**: User can archive/deprecate services (lifecycle management) — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **SVC-04**: User can view service directory with search and filter — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **SVC-05**: Service must have owning team (required on creation) — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **SVC-06**: Service can have optional escalation policy override (otherwise inherits team default) — ✅ Phase 11

### Service Dependencies

- [x] **DEP-01**: User can add dependency relationship between services — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DEP-02**: User can remove dependency relationship — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DEP-03**: System prevents circular dependencies (cycle detection on create/update) — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DEP-04**: User can view dependency graph visualization for a service — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DEP-05**: User can see upstream dependencies (what this service depends on) — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DEP-06**: User can see downstream dependents (what depends on this service) — ✅ Phase 12

### Alert Routing

- [x] **ROUTE-01**: Alert routes to service via routing_key from webhook payload — ✅ Phase 13
- [x] **ROUTE-02**: System falls back to TeamTag routing if no service match (backward compatibility) — ✅ Phase 13
- [x] **ROUTE-03**: Incident links to service when created via service routing — ✅ Phase 13
- [x] **ROUTE-04**: Integration can specify default service for alerts — ✅ Phase 13
- [x] **ROUTE-05**: Service routing respects escalation policy precedence (service > team) — ✅ Phase 13
